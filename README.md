# BIKESHARING

# Analysis Overview

* Background of the Project

We had made use of a bike rideshare application called "citi-bike" during our visit to New York this summer. We'd like to create a similar platform in Des-Moines, Iowa.

# Purpose of the Analysis.

The purpose of this project is to Anaylyze the model that makes citi-bike a success and present the results to our Angel investor to win funding for our own ride sharing application.


# Results

Here are the results from our Analysis

In comparison of longer rides, we have a higher percentage of female long distance riders than male long distance riders.

Majority of our female riders are subscribers and they ride on Thursdays. majority of our male riders are also subscribers and ride the most on Thursday. Majority of our unknown riders reide on Saturdays.


# Summary

We can observe from our analysis that customers have longer trip duration in comarison to subscribers. This may be because the bikes are used by tourists as most vustomers use the bikes on the weekends.

2. The commute time in des moines is shorter than the commute time in New York. But Des Moines definitely has a lot of tourist attractions and bike trails so Des Moines is a great place to start a biske sharibg app.
